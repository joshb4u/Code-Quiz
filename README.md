# Hw4 - Code Quiz - Pseudocode

1. Create index.html file.
2. Create ids for start page, quiz - questions with options page(s), quiz end page, entering name for high score page and high score list page.
3. Create a javascript file for addressing the quiz.
4. Create 3 arrays in JS - 1st array containing all the questions, second array containing all the options, 3rd array containing the index no. values of the correct answers from 2nd array.
5. Use DOM elements to get ids and also for creating variables and functions.
6. With the help of a function a count-down timer can be created.
7. An event listener can be created that can call this function to start the quiz by clicking on the start button. As a result, the start page needs to hide itself and go to the questions. Here the timer needs to start the count down also.
8. Create an if/ else statement that would display each question pagewise by going through the arrays to show the questions and options with the quiz ending at time 0 seconds.
9. The answer-options can be converted to buttons by creating a function and by using another if/ else statement "correct" and "wrong" text can be displayed along with the decrement in time if the answer is incorrect.
10. Another function needs to be created to move to the next question once any option button is clicked.
11. Create a function to display the quiz end page once the quiz gets over and also it needs to display text to input the user name for high scores.
12. Finally a function needs to be created to display the high-scores list.
13. High score buttons, go back button and clear buttons are also created to serve their purposes as shown in gif image.
